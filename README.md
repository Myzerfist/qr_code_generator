# qr_code_generator
Basic qr code generator and stores URLs in a database

Installing is nice and easy

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run main.py and enter the url

Updates?
- I might add gui with tkinter but this is just a learning project for my qr code recognition script i working on
